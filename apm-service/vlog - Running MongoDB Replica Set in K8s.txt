vlog - Running MongoDB Replica Set in K8s

1) Show the configuration locally 
- Mongo already installed locally via Brew, start it up
- Go through the Code really quickly - highlight the configuration
- (Before doing this, get a general error handler middleware in express working to cleanup code)

2) Install the Core Mongo DB Customer Resource Def
- Explain Operators briefly
- Show the Download site
- Walk through the steps of installation

3) Create the replica set
- Note that currently it seems like all needs to be in the same namespace

4) Update application code
- Show the couple of URI changes
- Show the environment variables
- Update the k8s deployment to have environment variables
- Remove nginx from the demo picture (maybe)
